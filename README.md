Isomorph JavaScript web-framework for node.js

This framework allows to use the same JavaScript code on back-end and front-end of your web-application using special module API.
Using this approach you will have version of web-site which will be rendered at back-end by direct link or search engine request and the same web-site representation when user loads new content at front-end when clicking some links or buttons. And all this stuff is rendering by same module and same code.

Details will be in documentation soon.
